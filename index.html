      <p align='justify'>
        Welcome to my personal website! I am a student in Master of Science in Financial Engineering (MSFE) at Columbia University. This year, I have earned a B.A. in Economics, a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.Eng. in Computer Science from Wuhan University, China.
      <p>
      	Till August, I was a visiting student and research assistant at <a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/">the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University</a>, hosted by <a href="http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianli/">Prof. Jian Li</a>. My research project was mainly about the causal deep network and its application in financial markets. Before joining Tsinghua University, I was a reseach assistant at the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, supervised by Prof. Bo Han. My works were mainly about causal inference and financial data mining.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research interests fall into the intersection between Finance and Computer Science. My previous and ongoing research topics include information trasmission and informed trading, theoretical causal inference and its application in finance and macroeconomics, and accounting & financial text mining.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I usually play table tennis and listen to music. My favorite table tennis athlete is Joo Sae-Hyuk and my favorite singer is JJ Lin.
