    <h4>Information Trasmission and Informed Trading<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></h4>
    <p align='justify'>
      Information transmits in the markets from one party to another. The attendance of the intermediate party can alleviate the information asymmetry between principal and agent to some extent. However, if the third party preserves its own utility, the intermediate may not transmit authentic and comprehensive information between principal and agent.
</p><p align="justify">
      Informed tradings are concerned by trading strategy developers and the market regulators. Apart from whether investors are informed, scholars are interested in investors' information source. Some investors have advanced ability to dig out mispricing securities and form their position based on public information while others may take advantages of private information. Exploiting private information gains abnormal returns and in turn creates market inefficiency. If private informed traders explain a proportional of tradings, the information disclosure regulations seems outdate. Previous research focused on periodic events such as earnings announcements. These events are deemed to happen in a limit period so their happening time could be considered as public information. For non-periodic events (i.e. trading halts), the value of the happening time should be measured separated from that of the contents. Plus, different markets may exhibit different empirical results under different information disclosure systems.

	  <h4>Causal Inference and Dynamic Causality<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></h4>
    <p align='justify'>
Causal Inference is a critical topic in many subjects like financial economics and medical biochemistry. Early analysis focused more on statistical dependence among variables. Beginning from linear regression models, nowadays complex statistical and algorithm-based models have been well constructed to perform accurate <b>prediction</b>. However, the effect of <b>interventions</b> can only be predicted after the causal relations are determined. 	  </p>
<p align='justify'> In theory, although the area of causal inference has been well established for cross-sectional causal relationships, for time series datasets, there exists few widely accepted framework among which Granger causality dominates. Inspired by the definition of linear time-invariant (LTI) causal system in the field of electronic engineering, if the “rule” (causal graph) is static, Granger’s F-test based on a simple vector-autoregression (VAR) is likely to perform well. While many papers published in the Journal of Econometrics focus on nonlinearities, another important research topic is <b>dynamic causality</b>. If the “rule” is dynamic (time-variant) , Granger causality test fails to tell how the rule is changing within a given period of time, due to the non-additive essence of regressions and corresponding statistical tests.</p>
<p align="justify">In the world of machine learning (ML) focusing on the accuracy of forecast, if the system is time-invariant, it seems no need for causality or causal graph to attain a good and stable performance. Examples are the applications on natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV) and reinforcement learning (RL). While the system is time-variant such as financial markets, ML always exhibits overfitting. Thus, when designing AI traders, a graphical causal convolutional network should be established to direct machine to <b>learn "the rule of the rule"</b>.</p>
