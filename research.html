	  <h4>Causal Inference<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></h4>

    <p align='justify'>
		    Modeling and Estimation of statistical dependences is a core problem of statistics and machine learning. The development of machine learning methods has enabled people in various fields to perform accurate prediction based on the discovered complex nonlinear dependences from data. However, when one aims to predict the outcomes of interventions, one need to figure out whether the dependences between variables encode causal information. Causal inference is to develop reliable theories and algorithms for causal discovery from empirical data. In recent years, scholars have developed novel methods to discover causal relationships from time series. Traditional econometrics have limit tools to reveal causality and novel machine learning and statistical methods may tell the same story from a rather different perspective.

	  <h4 >Private Information<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></h4>
    <p align='justify'>
        Informed tradings are concerned by trading strategy developers and the market regulators. Apart from whether investors are informed, scholars are interested in investors' information source. Some investors have advanced ability to dig out mispricing securities and form their position based on public information while others may take advantages of private information. Exploiting private information gains abnormal returns and in turn creates market ineffeciency. If private informed traders explain a proportional of tradings, the information disclosure regulations seems outdate. Previous research focused on periodic events such as earnings announcements. These events are deemed to happen in a limit period so their happening time could be considered as public information. For non-periodic events (i.e. trading halts), the value of the happening time should be measured seperated from that of the contents. Plus, different markets may exhibit different empirical results under different information disclosre systems.

	  <h4>Market Microstructure<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></h4>

    <p align='justify'>
      In high frequency data in financial markets, scholars found an abnormal high variance of some pivot financial indicators like log-price in the assumption of a brownian motion. This is named as market microstructure effect which could be caused by, either information or non-information related, such as the presence of a bid-ask spread and the corresponding bounces, the gradual response of prices to a block trade, the strategic component of order flow and so on. When the sampling rate increases, the signal-to-noise ration decreases. In other words, very high frequencey data are mostly composed of market microstructure noise, while the volatility is easier to measured in a longer scale. Empirical researchers tried to use aggregated or subsampled data to avoid microstructure noise. However, with the great loss of data, some high frequency features (i.e. high frequency causality) may hard to recover. Theoretical researchers tried to model the microstructure noise but is hard to be embeded in a VAR form. Now with the development of machine learning and computing algorithms, more empirical works could be done around market microstructure.
