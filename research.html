	  <h4>Causal Inference<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></h4>

    <p align='justify'>
		    Causal Inference is a critical topic in many subjects like financial economics and medical biochemistry. Early analysis focused more on statistical dependence among variables. Beginning from linear regression models, nowadays complex statistical and algorithm-based models have been well constructed to perform accurate prediction. However, the effect of interventions can only be predicted after the causal relations are determined. In economics and financial economics, traditional econometrics have limit tools to reveal causality and thier designs are so subtle that it is impossible for them to be widely used in financial markets or macroeconomics. Luckily, in recent years, scholars have developed novel methods to discover causal relations from time series, which tell the same story from a rather different perspective. Further research in economic and financial causality might focus on the combination of machine learning models with previously built econometric methods to help them fit better in economic and financial context.

	  <h4 >Private Information<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></h4>
    <p align='justify'>
      Informed tradings are concerned by trading strategy developers and the market regulators. Apart from whether investors are informed, scholars are interested in investors' information source. Some investors have advanced ability to dig out mispricing securities and form their position based on public information while others may take advantages of private information. Exploiting private information gains abnormal returns and in turn creates market inefficiency. If private informed traders explain a proportional of tradings, the information disclosure regulations seems outdate. Previous research focused on periodic events such as earnings announcements. These events are deemed to happen in a limit period so their happening time could be considered as public information. For non-periodic events (i.e. trading halts), the value of the happening time should be measured separated from that of the contents. Plus, different markets may exhibit different empirical results under different information disclosure systems.

	  <h4>Market Microstructure<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></h4>

    <p align='justify'>
      By using high frequency data in financial markets, scholars found an abnormal high variance of some pivot financial indicators like log-price in the Brownian assumption. This is named as market microstructure effect which could be caused by, either information or non-information related, such as the presence of a bid-ask spread and the corresponding bounces, the gradual response of prices to a block trade, the strategic component of order flow and so on. When the sampling rate increases, the signal-to-noise ration decreases. In other words, very high frequency data are mostly composed of market microstructure noise, while the volatility is easier to measure in a longer scale. Empirical researchers tried to use aggregated or subsampled data to avoid microstructure noise. However, with the great loss of data, some high frequency features (i.e. high frequency causality) may hard to recover. Theoretical researchers tried to model the microstructure noise but is hard to be embedded in a VAR form. Now with the development of machine learning and computing algorithms, more empirical works could be done around market microstructure.
