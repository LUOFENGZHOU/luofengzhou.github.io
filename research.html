	  <h4>Causal Inference and Dynamic Causality<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></h4>
    <p align='justify'>
Causal Inference is a critical topic in many subjects like financial economics and medical biochemistry. Early analysis focused more on statistical dependence among variables. Beginning from linear regression models, nowadays complex statistical and algorithm-based models have been well constructed to perform accurate <b>prediction</b>. However, the effect of <b>interventions</b> can only be predicted after the causal relations are determined. 	  </p>
<p align='justify'> In theory, although the area of causal inference has been well established for cross-sectional causal relationships, for time series datasets, there exists few widely accepted framework among which Granger causality dominates. Inspired by the definition of linear time-invariant (LTI) causal system in the field of electronic engineering, if the “rule” (causal graph) is static, Granger’s F-test based on a simple vector-autoregression (VAR) is likely to perform well. While many papers published in the Journal of Econometrics focus on nonlinearities, another important research topic is <b>dynamic causality</b>. If the “rule” is dynamic (time-variant) , Granger causality test fails to tell how the rule is changing within a given period of time, due to the non-additive essence of regressions and corresponding statistical tests.</p>
<p align="justify">In the world of machine learning (ML) focusing on the accuracy of forecast, if the system is time-invariant, it seems no need for causality or causal graph to attain a good and stable performance. Examples are the applications on natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV) and reinforcement learning (RL). While the system is time-variant such as financial markets, ML always exhibits overfitting. Thus, when designing AI traders, a graphical causal convolutional network should be established to direct machine to <b>learn the rule of the rule</b>.</p>

	  <h4>Market Microstructure<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></h4>
    <p align='justify'>
      By using high frequency data in financial markets, scholars found an abnormal high variance of some pivot financial indicators like log-price in the Brownian assumption. This is named as market microstructure effect which could be caused by, either information or non-information related, such as the presence of a bid-ask spread and the corresponding bounces, the gradual response of prices to a block trade, the strategic component of order flow and so on. When the sampling rate increases, the signal-to-noise ration decreases. In other words, very high frequency data are mostly composed of market microstructure noise, while the volatility is easier to measure in a longer scale. Empirical researchers tried to use aggregated or subsampled data to avoid microstructure noise. However, with the great loss of data, some high frequency features (i.e. high frequency causality) may hard to recover. Theoretical researchers tried to model the microstructure noise but is hard to be embedded in a VAR form. Now with the development of machine learning and computing algorithms, more empirical works could be done around market microstructure.
